## üöÄ Running the Examples

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- The `uv` package manager
- Access to a Db2 for i database with appropriate permissions
- Mapepire service running on your IBM i system

### Environment Setup

1. **Important**: First, run the environment setup script from the parent directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../../examples/ # Navigate to the examples directory 
   ./setup_env.sh
   cd agents/security
   ```
   This will create a `.env` file template in the examples directory.

2. (Optional) create the `.env` file in the `security` directory with your specific credentials:
   ```
   HOST=your_ibmi_host
   DB_USER=your_username
   PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_PORT=your_db_port
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```
   this will overwrite the `.env` file created in the parent directory.

### Running the Security Assistant

The Security Assistant provides an interactive interface for analyzing system security:

```bash
uv run security_assistant.py
```

You can customize the CLI with these options:

```bash
uv run security_assistant.py --model-id ollama:qwen2.5 --stream --debug
```

> üí° **Note**: By default, this example uses OpenAI's GPT-4.1 model. You can specify a different model with `--model-id`.

### Example CLI Commands

Once the CLI is running, you can use these commands:

```
What tools do you have access to?   - List available tools and capabilities
check exposed profiles              - Check for user profiles with insufficient security
analyze user authorities            - Review user profile authorities and permissions
security audit                      - Perform comprehensive security audit
how can I fix the profiles          - Generate commands to fix security issues
fix them for me                     - Allow the agent to fix the vulnerabilities
system security status              - Get overall system security assessment
exit                                - Exit the application
```

### üìù Security Agent Playground

This example provides a chat UI testing environment for the security agent.

Follow these steps to run the playground:

1. Setup Agno agent playground:
   - Follow the instructions in the [Playground docs](https://docs.agno.com/introduction/playground)
   - Once the playground is setup, you can interact with the security agent in a chat-like interface.

2. Start the playground server:
   ```bash
   uv run playground.py
   ```

### ü§ñ Core Agent

Run the core security agent implementation:

```bash
uv run agent.py
```

### üìì Security Test Notebook

Open the Jupyter notebook for interactive security testing:

```bash
jupyter notebook test_security_assistant.ipynb
```

4. **CLI Functionality**: Extend command capabilities
5. **Reporting**: Customize security report formats
6. **Integration**: Connect with external security tools

### Example Customizations:

```python
# Add custom security checks
CUSTOM_SECURITY_CHECKS = [
    "SELECT * FROM QSYS2.USER_INFO() WHERE DAYS_UNTIL_PASSWORD_EXPIRES < 7",
    "SELECT * FROM QSYS2.OBJECT_PRIVILEGES WHERE OBJECT_AUTHORITY = '*ALL'"
]

# Configure security thresholds
SECURITY_THRESHOLDS = {
    "max_exposed_profiles": 5,
    "password_expiry_warning": 14,
    "inactive_user_days": 90
}
```

## üéØ Security Best Practices

When using these examples:

1. **Regular Audits**: Schedule regular security assessments
