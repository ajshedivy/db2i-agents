}
```

## üéØ Service Integration Patterns

Common patterns for IBM i service integration:

### Real-time Monitoring
```python
# Continuous monitoring with alerts
def monitor_service(service_function, threshold, interval=60):
    while True:
        result = service_function()
        if check_threshold(result, threshold):
            send_alert(result)
        time.sleep(interval)
```

### Batch Analysis
```python
# Periodic batch analysis
def batch_analysis(services, schedule="daily"):
    for service in services:
        data = collect_service_data(service)
        analysis = ai_analyze(data)
        store_results(analysis)
```

### Predictive Analytics
```python
# AI-powered trend analysis
def predict_trends(historical_data, forecast_days=30):
    model = train_model(historical_data)
    predictions = model.predict(forecast_days)
    return generate_recommendations(predictions)
```

## üö® Important Considerations

### Permissions
- Ensure appropriate authorities for accessing system services
- Some services require special authorities (*AUDIT, *ALLOBJ, etc.)
- Test permissions in development environments first

### Performance
- Monitor query performance on large systems
- Use appropriate filtering to limit result sets
- Consider caching for frequently accessed data

### Security
- Follow security best practices when accessing system information
- Log and audit service access appropriately
- Protect sensitive system information
