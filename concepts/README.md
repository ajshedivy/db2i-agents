# AI Agent Concepts for Db2

This directory contains explorations of high-level AI agent concepts. These concept implementations serve as educational resources and proof-of-concept demonstrations across various agentic design patterns.


## Concept Areas

### üß† Knowledge
Implementations related to how agents store, retrieve, and utilize knowledge about Db2 schemas, SQL syntax, and database concepts.

### üíæ Memory
Demonstrations of different memory mechanisms that allow agents to recall past Db2 interactions, query history, and maintain context across sessions.

### üîÑ Reasoning
Examples showing how different reasoning approaches (chain-of-thought, ReAct, etc.) can improve Db2 query generation, error handling, and data analysis.

### üìä Storage
Approaches for persisting agent state, learning from past interactions, and maintaining vector databases for Db2-related knowledge.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools
Collection of specialized tools that agents can use to interact with Db2, such as query validation, schema exploration, and result formatting.

## Implementation Philosophy

Each concept implementation aims to:

1. **Be Framework-Agnostic**: Core ideas should be adaptable across agent frameworks
2. **Focus on Db2**: Demonstrate how general agent concepts can be tailored for Db2 for i and IBM i interactions
3. **Remain Simple**: Emphasize clarity and educational value over production readiness
4. **Document Clearly**: Include explanations of the concepts and their implementation

## Usage

These concept implementations can be:

- Used as learning resources for understanding AI agent capabilities
- Incorporated into more comprehensive agent implementations
- Extended to build specialized Db2-focused agents
- Compared across frameworks to understand different implementation approaches

## Contributing

To add a new concept implementation:

1. Choose the appropriate concept category folder
2. Create a clearly named directory for your implementation
3. Include a README explaining the concept and implementation
4. Provide simple, well-commented code examples
5. Add any necessary documentation or examples
